## Background
We plan to extract tweets from two famous people who are reasonably 
different from each other in their views / speech patterns / post content.

## Research Question
Is there a difference between the way Prof. Alex Shpenev tweets and Prof. Eugen 
Dimant tweets?

## Motivation
We plan to extract tweets from  Prof. Alex Shpenev tweets and Prof. Eugen 
Dimant because they teach different subjects, have different 
interests (beyond behavioral science), and have different speech patterns.
So we think it would be interesting to compare their tweets to see if we can
build an algorithm that can identify these differences we noticed based on our
observations.
